                            This morning, the Supreme Court announced its 6-3 decision to overturn the 1973 Roe v Wade decision, which established a person’s constitutional right to have an abortion. Under the new ruling, abortion law will be determined by the states, effectively ending abortion rights for millions of Americans.</br></br>
                            The Greater Lafayette Democratic Socialists of America (GLDSA) and Purdue Young Democratic Socialists of America (YDSA) condemn this arbitrary and undemocratic ruling. This decision tramples on the basic rights of all Americans and must be opposed.</br></br>
                            GLDSA and YDSA call on all concerned community members to gather at the Tippecanoe County Courthouse in downtown Lafayette on <b>Wednesday, June 29th at 5:00 pm</b> to protest the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v Wade.</br></br>
                            This decision has come despite the fact that a strong majority of Americans support the right to an abortion. Five of the nine Supreme Court justices were appointed by a president who lost the popular vote, and confidence in the court is at a historic low. State legislatures are notorious for being heavily gerrymandered. Yet, these are the bodies that decide whether or not Americans have access to this basic healthcare right.</br></br>
                            The reckless decisions of the Supreme Court can only be effectively opposed if working class people come together in our workplaces and communities to fight for our rights. The elites have forgotten that nothing in this country runs unless working people make it happen. In the coming days and months, we hope to give them a reminder. As the great Hoosier socialist Eugene Debs said, “I care nothing about the Supreme Court, corporation lawyers every one of them. The Supreme Court is not the court of last resort; the people are.”</br></br>
                            Greater Lafayette Democratic Socialists of America is a local chapter of Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), the largest socialist organization in the USA. Young Democratic Socialists is the youth wing of DSA.
