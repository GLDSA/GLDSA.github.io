                        <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,0.9);background: rgb(238,238,238);border-style: solid;border-color: rgb(236,31,39);"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,0.9);"><strong>This statement is provided by the Greater Lafayette DSA, as a local supplement to&nbsp;the DSA National Statement, which we support.</strong></span></div>
                        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;">One month into the outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States, we have witnessed how the poor, working class, unhoused people, immigrants, Asians, African Americans, Latinx, and other marginalized groups have disproportionately
                            suffered. Instead of protecting the health and financial well-being of these groups, the Trump administration has continued its efforts to weaken environmental protections; encourage racism and xenophobia; and cut funding for
                            services such as Medicare, Social Security, and SNAP (food stamps). In our area, local manufacturers like SIA and Arconic have already laid off workers or slowed production. Food banks are overwhelmed with demands that cannot
                            be met. The scale of this crisis and its implications for capitalism are difficult to fathom.</p>
                        <h4><strong>We reject austerity, privatization, racism, and xenophobia. Instead, we with the&nbsp;working class, poor, and marginalized of our society demand a working-class solution to&nbsp;the COVID-19 crisis.</strong></h4>
                        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;">We cannot mitigate this public health crisis without comprehensive healthcare, free at the point of use, to all U.S. residents, such as Bernie Sanders’ proposed Medicare for All legislation. Nearly 17 million people have already
                            filed for unemployment. We will need a jobs program, such as the Green New Deal, to rebuild our infrastructure and avoid catastrophic climate change, which will make natural disasters and global pandemics more frequent and
                            intense. We encourage everyone who can, to donate to relief funds and participate in local mutual aid groups, such as the Greater Lafayette COVID-19 Mutual Aid Response and the Tippecanoe Solidarity Network. The Greater Lafayette
                            COVID-19 Mutual Aid Response’s growth to over 1,800 members has been a silver lining of this crisis. It represents a desire for collective action in our community. At the same time, we cannot let voluntary efforts be a substitute
                            for appropriate government action.</p>
                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="col">
                                <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;">The US had months to prepare for the outbreak of COVID-19 since it was first reported in China. However, President Donald Trump and the federal government squandered this opportunity to act early to slow the pandemic. The
                                    lack of a nationwide strategy to address the pandemic, with consistent regulations and guidelines, and a plan to develop, manufacture, and deploy key resources such as testing, ventilators, and personal protective equipment,
                                    has made the situation much worse and will likely cost many lives. We must demand action at all levels of government to fight the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;font-weight: bold;color: #ec1f27;font-style: italic;font-size: 15px;">We are calling upon President Trump; the U.S. House and Senate; Governor Holcomb; the Indiana General Assembly; Mayors Roswarski and Dennis; Tippecanoe County Officials; the City Councils of Lafayette and West Lafayette;
                                    President Daniels; and the Purdue University Board of Trustees to enact the following measures:<br></p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <h5 style="font-family: 'Manifold DSA Extra';font-weight: normal;font-style: normal;text-align: left;">Use Indiana’s budget reserves to provide for people in need and to compensate for the lack of federal resources available for adequate testing and personal protective equipment.</h5>
                        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;">One out of seven Indiana residents lives in poverty, and one out of ten is uninsured. Meanwhile, in 2019 Indiana had a budget surplus of $267 million and a total of $2.27 billion in budget reserves. While we have these financial
                            resources at hand, it is unacceptable that we allow more than 600,000 Hoosiers to be uninsured or underinsured during the greatest public health crisis in a century.</p>
                        <h5 style="font-family: 'Manifold DSA Extra';font-weight: normal;font-style: normal;text-align: left;">Dedicate state resources to providing necessary medical supplies, testing, and hospital access to vulnerable communities of color.</h5>
                        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;">Our state is following a national pattern of disproportionate COVID-19 infection and death rates among African Americans. The major outbreak areas in Indiana have been places with the largest African-American populations: Indianapolis
                            and Northwest Indiana. Despite being less than 10% of Indiana’s population, African Americans represent nearly 20% of those who have died from COVID-19. In Chicago, just across our state line, more than 70% of deaths caused
                            by COVID-19 have taken the lives of African Americans. This pattern suggests the unequal effects of the virus on the already vulnerable: a form of medical apartheid.</p>
                        <h5 style="font-family: 'Manifold DSA Extra';font-weight: normal;font-style: normal;text-align: left;">Create a hotline dedicated to the pandemic, fully staffed 24 hours a day, that provides competent advice and expertise, and that respects confidentiality and anonymity of the callers.</h5>
                        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;">Local reporting mechanisms are essential for people to report suspected cases of COVID-19, ask questions, or get advice. The Indiana State Department of Health refers calls about COVID-19 to its Epidemiology Resource Center (317-233-7125).
                            Calls must not lead to involvement of law enforcement, ICE, or detention of callers against their will.</p>
                        <h5 style="font-family: 'Manifold DSA Extra';font-weight: normal;font-style: normal;text-align: left;">Ensure adequate protective measures for healthcare workers.</h5>
                        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;">Healthcare workers are simultaneously the most important to public health during the pandemic and most at risk due to repeated exposure. All hospital and care facilities must brief workers on what measures are being taken to mitigate
                            risks they face when providing care. This includes providing housing to healthcare workers who wish to isolate themselves from at-risk roommates, friends, and family.</p>
                        <h5 style="font-family: 'Manifold DSA Extra';font-weight: normal;font-style: normal;text-align: left;">Provide $15 minimum wage, paid sick leave, and hazard pay for essential workers during the pandemic, and ensure that workers may wear available personal protective equipment.</h5>
                        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;">The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the importance of some of the most underappreciated and undercompensated workers. We support workers striking for better compensation and working conditions, such as workers for Amazon, Whole
                            Foods, and Instacart.</p>
                        <h5 style="font-family: 'Manifold DSA Extra';font-weight: normal;font-style: normal;text-align: left;">Do not fire, furlough, or lay-off any Purdue University employees because of the pandemic.</h5>
                        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;">The University must also set up an emergency fund to assist Purdue faculty, staff, and students who need medical assistance. Finally, the University should prioritize expanding wages and benefits to help Purdue employees assist
                            their families who may be suffering from consequences of the pandemic at home.</p>
                        <h5 style="font-family: 'Manifold DSA Extra';font-weight: normal;font-style: normal;text-align: left;">Further expand unemployment benefits to cover the contingent workforce (gig, temporary, and contract workers), self-employed, part-time, and new workers, using state funds to supplement federal funding where necessary.</h5>
                        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;">We appreciate recent executive orders expanding unemployment benefits. However, these benefits do not cover all workers and are often difficult to obtain. These benefits, as well as the federal cash payments, must be made easy
                            to obtain, so people do not have to stand in line or wait in offices, increasing their risk to the virus.</p>
                        <h5 style="font-family: 'Manifold DSA Extra';font-weight: normal;font-style: normal;text-align: left;">Place a moratorium on rent, mortgage, utility payments, and student loan payments.</h5>
                        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;">We welcome the hold on evictions, foreclosures, and, in some cases, utility shutoffs in Indiana during the public health emergency, yet it does not relieve obligations to pay rent or mortgage. Therefore, it does not go far enough
                            to protect those recently unemployed or facing financial hardship because of the pandemic. If workers are unable to work because of the stay-at-home order, they should not be expected to pay rent, mortgage, utility bills, or
                            student loans. Goods like housing, water, electricity, and the internet should be provided as social rights to everyone.</p>
                        <h5 style="font-family: 'Manifold DSA Extra';font-weight: normal;font-style: normal;text-align: left;">Ensure adequate shelter with healthcare and food for all during and after the pandemic to permanently end homelessness in Indiana.</h5>
                        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;">Homeless people are at a high risk of both getting COVID-19 and dying from it. State officials recognize this insofar as they have partnered with private non-profit organizations and the National Guard to provide shelter during
                            the pandemic. Similar efforts need to be replicated in Tippecanoe County and across the state.</p>
                        <h5 style="font-family: 'Manifold DSA Extra';font-weight: normal;font-style: normal;text-align: left;">End cash bail, end electronic ankle monitoring, and grant reprieve to prisoners close to the end of their sentences, low-level offenders, and those at risk due to age or comorbidities.</h5>
                        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;">Nearly 50,000 men, women, and children are incarcerated across Indiana. Without immediate bold action, we will face a public health catastrophe in our jails. Due to overcrowding and proximity, there is no such thing as social distancing
                            in prison or jail. Once the virus gets inside a jail, it is impossible to control infection. The Indiana Department of Correction, the Tippecanoe County Sheriff’s Office, and Tippecanoe County judges must release individuals
                            from prisons, jails, and detection centers, including the Tippecanoe County Jail, and properly staff facilities with medical teams to ensure the wellbeing of those who cannot be released. Finally, we encourage law enforcement
                            to overlook non-moving and minor traffic violations to reduce contact and prevent contagion.</p>
                        <h5 style="font-family: 'Manifold DSA Extra';font-weight: normal;font-style: normal;text-align: left;">Rescind Governor Holcomb’s executive order requiring abortions to be postponed as a non-essential, elective procedure.</h5>
                        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;">This is clearly an excuse to eliminate womens’ right to choose. Abortions cannot be postponed without becoming impossible. We also demand that abortion services be included in loosened restrictions on telemedicine to protect patients
                            from unnecessary exposure to the virus.</p>
                        <h5 style="font-family: 'Manifold DSA Extra';font-weight: normal;font-style: normal;text-align: left;">Call for an end to pandemic-related racial prejudice and offer a safety hotline, not routed to law enforcement, that people who experience racist or xenophobic violence related to COVID-19 can call for assistance.</h5>
                        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;">Since COVID-19 was first identified in Wuhan, China, racial discrimination against Asian people in the US has escalated. Public officials, particularly President Trump, have stoked xenophobia and racism to divert attention away
                            from their failure onto an external enemy, namely China. From March 19 to April 3, 2020, the STOP AAPI HATE reporting center alone has received over 1,100 reports of coronavirus discrimination from Asian Americans across the
                            country.</p>
                        <h5 style="font-family: 'Manifold DSA Extra';font-weight: normal;font-style: normal;text-align: left;">Ease sanctions and act in solidarity with other countries, particularly those of the Global South.</h5>
                        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;">During the COVID-19 crisis, the Trump administration has intensified sanctions on Iran, intentionally weakening its healthcare system, with the result that it cannot save thousands of lives. The Trump administration has also imposed
                            or threatened to impose new sanctions on Nicaragua and Venezuela. The populations in these countries are not responsible for the government policies targeted by sanctions and to varying degrees have already been living in a
                            precarious situation. On the other hand, we applaud the internationalist spirit of Cuban medical brigades who have traveled to countries such as Italy to fight the virus despite the US blockade. Xenophobic and “America-First”
                            policies are dangerous and counterproductive in addressing the pandemic.</p>
