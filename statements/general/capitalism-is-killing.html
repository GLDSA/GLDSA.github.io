                        <div class="post-info"><span style="color: #ec1f27;font-family: 'Manifold DSA';">By Greater Lafayette DSA</span><span style="color: #ec1f27;font-family: 'Manifold DSA';">Jan 27, 2018</span></div>
                        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;">In just the past two months the brutal effects of U.S. capitalism have generated new waves of rage among ordinary people:</p>
                        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;">The so-called ‘leak’ of a draft opinion by Supreme Court Judge Samuel Alito arguing for overturning Roe V. Wade has brought 
                            hundreds of thousands of people back into the streets to defend reproductive justice.  In Lafayette, <a style="color: #ec1f27;" href="https://www.jconline.com/story/news/local/lafayette/2022/05/14/bans-off-our-bodies-march-lafayette-indiana/9779359002/">a strong contingent of protesters rallied</a> at the Tippecanoe County 
                            Courthouse to express their outrage:  <a style="color: #ec1f27;" href="https://www.jconline.com/story/news/2022/05/04/both-sides-roe-v-wade-debate-rally-purdue-campus/9653671002/">A second march</a> was held just before the end of term at the Purdue campus.  Four of the five justices who signed the draft opinion 
                            were appointed by presidents who lost the popular vote and confirmed by senators representing less than 50% of the U.S. population. Two-thirds of Americans oppose overturning Roe v. Wade.</p>
                        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;">On May 14th, white supremacist Peyton Gendron <a style="color: #ec1f27;" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/buffalo-supermarket-shooter-livestream-manifesto-hate-crime-1353292/">murdered 10 African-Americans</a> at a Buffalo, New York supermarket.  Gendron posted on-line a racist 
                            manifesto inspired by other white nationalists like Anders Breivik. The murders took place at the only supermarket in a predominantly Black working-class neighborhood of Buffalo.</p>
                        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;">On May 24th, an 18 year-old Texan <a style="color: #ec1f27;" href="https://apnews.com/article/uvalde-texas-school-shooting-44a7cfb990feaa6ffe482483df6e4683">shot and killed 21 people</a>, including 19 children, in the predominantly Mexican-American working-class city 
                            of Uvalde, Texas: Instead of stopping the killer, the police waited outside, blocking parents from entering the school themselves. The killer had purchased AR-style rifles just after 
                            his 18th birthday.  Texas has among the most lenient open-carry gun laws in the state.</p>
                        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;">Greater Lafayette DSA joins with socialists, feminists, LGBTQ+ organizers and anti-racists everywhere in calling for renewed defense of the 
                            most vulnerable in our society.  Women under threat of losing their right to an abortion, and working-class people of color constantly menaced by a state that doesn’t value their 
                            lives, must be protected.</p>
                        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;">Only a socialist society which puts people before profits, shares society’s resources equally, and teaches fraternity, solidarity and cooperation can overcome patriarchal racial capitalism.</p>
                        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;"><strong>We mourn for the dead and organize for tomorrow.</strong></p>
