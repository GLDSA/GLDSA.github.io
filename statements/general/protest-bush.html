                        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;">Purdue has announced that former U.S. President George Bush will join Mitch Daniels for the final conversation in Daniels' Presidential Lecture Series.</p>
                        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;">The <a style="color: #ec1f27;" href="https://www.wthr.com/article/news/local/former-us-president-george-w-bush-purdue-university-mitch-daniels-final-lecture-series-event-december-6/531-81309a5d-a91a-47c6-847c-4034c86a787d">event</a> is scheduled for Tuesday, Dec. 6th at 6 p.m. at Elliott Hall. Join us outside of Elliott Hall at 5pm on Dec 6th to protest this disgusting attempt to legitimize the disastrous and deadly presidency of George Bush, and Mitch Daniels' central role in it. You can sign our petition to protest and call out Bush and Daniels involvement in the Iraq War <a a style="color: #ec1f27;" href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/protest-iraq-war-criminals-george-bush-and-mitch-daniels/">here</a>!</p>
                        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;">Bush and Daniels are forever linked as architects of the 2003 U.S. invasion and war against Iraq. Daniels enabled the war as Director of Bush’s Office of Management and Budget in 2002. He estimated the war would cost the U.S. only <a style="color: #ec1f27;" href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/george-packer/mitch-danielss-iraq-war">50-60 million dollars</a>, a low number meant to sell the war to his boss and to the public.</p>
                        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;">The resulting invasion of Iraq — a country that was falsely claimed by George Bush to be responsible for 9/11 — created one of the greatest humanitarian crises in human history. More than <a style="color: #ec1f27;" href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/costs/human/civilians/iraqi">200,000 Iraqi civilians</a> have lost their lives because of U.S. violence. At least <a style="color: #ec1f27;" href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/costs/human/refugees/iraqi"></a>9 million Iraqis have been displaced from their homeland by the war. The United States has spent at least <a style="color: #ec1f27;" href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/costs/human/refugees/iraqi">2 trillion dollars</a> on the war. At least 4,500 U.S. soldiers have lost their lives.</p>
                        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;">We call on those opposed to war, opposed to U.S. imperialism, and opposed to violence, racism, and nationalism to join us in protesting the warmongers George Bush and Mitch Daniels.</p>
                        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;">Join us as we raise our voices in protest for the dead and fight for the living.</p>
