                        <div class="post-info"><span style="color: #ec1f27;font-family: 'Manifold DSA';">Greater Lafayette DSA</span><span style="color: #ec1f27;font-family: 'Manifold DSA';">Jan 29, 2021</span></div>
                        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;">On Monday, February 1, 2021, the West Lafayette City Council will vote on a resolution urging congress to pass the Medicare for All Act of 2019 (H.R. 1384, S. 1129) and the Health Care Emergency Guarantee Act of 2020 (H.R. 6906).
                            <strong>The resolution was written and campaigned for by Greater Lafayette Democratic Socialists of America (GLDSA).</strong> Five members of the City Council have sponsored it. A copy of the resolution can be found <a style="color: #ec1f27;" href="https://www.westlafayette.in.gov/egov/documents/1611926072_3359.pdf">here</a>.&nbsp;<br><br>The
                            Health Care Emergency Guarantee Act of 2020 would empower Medicare to cover all&nbsp;healthcare costs for the uninsured and all out-of-pocket expenses for those with insurance for&nbsp;the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.
                            The Medicare for All Act would establish a single-payer&nbsp;universal healthcare system, with no cost-sharing.<br></p>
                        <h4 style="font-family: 'Manifold DSA Extra';">Health Crisis in Tippecanoe County</h4>
                        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;">The resolution addresses the urgent healthcare needs of West Lafayette and Tippecanoe&nbsp;County. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, it is estimated that more than 20,000 residents of&nbsp;Tippecanoe County did not have any health
                            insurance. Approximately 2,000 Tippecanoe County&nbsp;residents have lost their jobs due to the pandemic, increasing the number of residents who are&nbsp;uninsured. Many residents of West Lafayette, who do have health insurance,
                            are underinsured&nbsp;resulting in medical expenses that exceed their ability to pay. While insurance companies are&nbsp;making record breaking profits, many people are not getting the healthcare they need which&nbsp;increases
                            the consequences and spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
                        <h4 style="font-family: 'Manifold DSA Extra';">Community Support</h4>
                        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;">Sponsors of the resolution include council members David Sanders, James Blanco, Kathy&nbsp;Parker, Gerald Thomas, and Larry Leverenz, as well as the Greater Lafayette chapter of the&nbsp;<a style="color: #ec1f27;" href="http://aauppurdue.org/">American Association of University Professors</a>,
                            the Greater Lafayette chapter of the <a style="color: #ec1f27;" href="https://ywtf-gla.aauw.net/">Younger&nbsp;Women’s Task Force</a>, <a style="color: #ec1f27;" href="https://www.lafayetteindivisible.com/">Greater Lafayette Indivisible</a>, and <a style="color: #ec1f27;" href="https://standingforgood.com/">Greater Lafayette Immigrant Allies</a>.&nbsp;Similar
                            resolutions citing local healthcare needs in support of Medicare for All have been passed&nbsp;in other U.S. cities including <a style="color: #ec1f27;" href="http://docs.southbendin.gov/weblink/0/doc/312577/Page1.aspx">South Bend</a> and <a style="color: #ec1f27;" href="https://www.bloomington.in.gov/council/legislation/Resolution/2006/06-16">Bloomington, Indiana.</a>&nbsp;<br></p>

                                <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;">GLDSA began campaigning for the resolution in October 2020 with a kickoff event in Columbian&nbsp;Park. In December, they held a virtual town hall with speakers from National Nurses United,&nbsp;Medicare for All Indiana,
                                    and Central Indiana DSA, and city council member James Blanco. At&nbsp;the same time, GLDSA left flyers at homes in West Lafayette and canvassed outside the&nbsp;Lafayette Farmers Market and at the CityBus Center. More
                                    than 650 Tippecanoe County&nbsp;residents have signed GLDSA’s petition at http://m4a.GLDSA.org.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></p>
