## Who We Are
We are the Greater Lafayette chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America covering the cites of Lafayette, West Lafayette, and surrounding areas. We're building a movement that's centered on democracy, cooperation, and transformative justice. A better world is possible, and we can get there by organizing our communities into a mass movement of the working class, but we can't do it without you! Get involved today and help us build an economy and a society that works for all of us, not just the wealthy few.
